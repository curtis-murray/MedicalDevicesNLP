Of the 332 patients who underwent AC, 100 female patients (mean age of 64.9 years) underwent AC with mesh (between Mar2004 and Oct2008) and 83 female patients (mean age of 65.3 years) underwent AC without mesh (between Jan2002 and Dec2005) attended the audit follow-up. In AC with mesh, mesh used was either Prolift (n=49) or Perigee (n=51).\n\nIn the follow-up period, recurrent cystocele of =stage 2 was observed in 33 patients in AC with mesh group.\n\nAt a mean of four years’ follow-up, mesh augmentation was associated with reduced cystocele recurrence, but this effect was limited to patients with levator avulsion.","Prolift mesh transvaginal causing pain in vagina and hip","Patient had anterior and posterior Prolift mesh implanted. Mesh erosion with both meshes that were removed.","This is in reference to article titled: Is levator avulsion a predictor of cystocele recurrence following anterior vaginal mesh placement? published in Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol. 2013;\nReported complications included symptoms of recurrence, i.e. sensation of a vaginal lump or a dragging sensation, mesh erosion, and cystocele recurrence. It was reported that levator avulsion was a significant predictor of cystocele recurrence on ultrasonography. In conclusion, avulsion of the puborectalis muscle, as diagnosed by TUI, is associated with an increased risk of cystocele recurrence following transobturator anterior compartment mesh repair.","Recurrent UTI and new onset of pelvic pain, urge and stress incontinence patient has not been able to have intercourse since the procedure.","Mesh erosion.","Anterior prolift vaginal mesh exposure","Following a laparoscopic hernia procedure, the patient has had an allergic reaction.

A total of 95 women with International Continence Society pelvic organ prolapse quantification stage 2 or more underwent vaginal surgery using mesh augmentation and a VSD and were included in the study. The surgical technique varied according the site of the pelvic organ prolapse. A Gynemesh PS mesh was used during surgery for all cases. When mesh was used in the anterior vaginal repair, the vaginal epithelium was dissected off the underlying pre-vesical tissue. Laterally, dissection continued until each arcus tendineus fascia pelvis was reached. A modified repair of the pre-vesical tissue was performed using Monocryl 2-0 sutures. Only the central part of the pre-vesical tissue was repaired. This avoided narrowing of the pre-vesical space. The vaginal epithelium was closed in two layers. The deeper layer was closed using a continuous sub-epithelial non-interlocking stitch of Monocryl 2-0 suture. The epithelium was then closed by a non-interlocking continuous everting mattress stitch using Vicryl 2 0 suture. At the completion of surgery, an appropriately sized VSD was placed in the vagina and sutured in place with Monocryl 2-0 suture to prevent dislodgement. Reported complications included recurrent prolapse (n-12), pelvic hematoma (n-1) which required transvaginal drainage, mesh exposure (n-4), extrusion of VSD (n-1), protrusion of VSD (n-14), and slippage of VSD (n-8). It was concluded that vaginal surgery using mesh and a VSD is an effective procedure for pelvic organ prolapse. However, further studies are required to establish the role of the surgery described in this study.","This is in reference to article Vaginal repair with mesh versus colporrhaphy for prolapse: a randomised controlled trial published in an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology.\n\nThe objectives of this prospective randomized control trial was to compare vaginal repair augmented by mesh with traditional colporrhaphy for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. A total of 139 women with Stage 2 prolapse underwent anterior and posterior compartment repair and were included in the study. Of which, 69 patients were randomized to mesh group and 70 patients were randomized to traditional anterior and posterior colporrhaphy (no mesh group). During the surgical procedure, when the Gynemesh PS mesh was used in the anterior vaginal repair, a full thickness midline epithelial incision was made. The central area of the pre-vesical fascia was repaired with Monocryl 2-0 sutures to avoid narrowing of the pre-vesical space. The mesh was soaked in an antibiotic solution prior to placement and liberal wound irrigation with saline was performed during surgery. A cross-shaped piece of mesh was cut and placed over the pre-vesical tissue with the extension arms placed into each paravaginal space. The mesh extension arms abutted the inner aspect of the pubic bone on each side. During the posterior vaginal repair, a ‘Y’-shaped piece of mesh was cut and placed over the pre-rectal tissue with the extension arms placed in the tunnels created by the dissection onto the sacrospinous ligaments. The mesh extension arms abutted each sacrospinous ligament. Mesh was not placed in the lower third of the posterior vaginal wall. In the mesh group, reported complication included vaginal mesh exposure (n-4) which was treated with simple surgical excision of the exposed mesh in 3 patients and conservative management in 1 patient.","Excruciating pain now for 5yrs.","Presented with pain and UTI symptoms.

The treatment of pelvic prolapse with uterine conservation using the sacral hysteropexy may be associated with less patient morbidity but has uncertain subjective and objective outcomes.","This is in reference to article Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy: how low does the mesh go? published in Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2017; 49: 404–408, DOI: 10.1002/uog.15882, Published online 7 February 2017.\n\nSummary: The aim of this study was to document the postoperative anterior mesh position after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy and to investigate the relationship between mesh location and anterior compartment support. Between January 2005 and June 2012, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy was performed in all patients who had apical prolapse = Stage 2 or advanced prolapse =Stage 3 in the anterior compartment.\nRecurrent prolapse symptoms were reported in 30 (32%) women. Clinical prolapse recurrence (ICS POP-Q=Stage 2) was diagnosed in 80 patients, including 60 cases affecting the anterior compartment and 43 affecting the posterior compartment; however, recurrence in the apical compartment was not diagnosed in any patient. Nine patients had de-novo development of anterior compartment prolapse and 17 of posterior compartment prolapse.\nThe tacks in the levator muscle were palpable in 20 patients, 16 (17%) of whom complained of tenderness upon palpation and 12 (12%) had symptomatic dyspareunia.\nUltrasound volume analysis was performed approximately 6 months after data acquisition. Eighty-one patients had sonographic prolapse recurrence: 52 in the anterior compartment, 64 in the posterior compartment and 11 in the apical compartment. In patients who had concomitant paravaginal repairs, 49 had significant preoperative cystocele on clinical examination with 45 being =Stage 3, and 24 had a significant rectocelewith 15 being =Stage 3. At follow-up, 35 patients had recurrence in the anterior compartment with three patients having cystocele recurrence =Stage 3, and 24 had recurrence in the posterior compartment with four cases of de-novo prolapse. In 37 patients, the mesh was not visible on ultrasound. This was likely because the mesh was located too cranial for visualization. Analysis of these patients showed that 30% (11/37) were symptomatic of prolapse and 84% (31/37) had significant prolapse on POP-Q assessment: 21 in the anterior compartment, 17 in the posterior compartment and none in the apical compartment. On ultrasound, 76% (28/37) of these patients had significant prolapse, 21 in the anterior compartment, 16 in the posterior compartment and three in the apical compartment. Of those patients in whom mesh could be visualized on ultrasound, 33% (20/60) were symptomatic of prolapse at follow-up and 88% (53/60) had recurrent prolapse on POP-Q assessment: 39 in the anterior compartment, 30 in the posterior compartment and none in the apical compartment. On ultrasound, 75% (45/60) of these women had recurrent prolapse, with 29 in the anterior, 33 in the posterior and seven in the apical compartment. In conclusion, using 4D ultrasound for evaluation of mesh mobility and location following laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy has given us a perspective on where placement of mesh may result in failure. The authors found a correlation between mesh location and prolapse recurrence, particularly for the anterior compartment.","Constant disabling chronic pain.","Pain and abdominal swelling following hernia repair.","Solyx single incision sling erosion into urethra.
